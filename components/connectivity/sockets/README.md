# Sockets

This component provides the sockets API. Add library `cmsis-sockets-api` to your project as a linked library to use it.

You must also add an implementation library, like `lwip-sockets` provided in the sdk.

The source of the API used is (IoT_Socket)[https://github.com/MDK-Packs/IoT_Socket].
Documentation is available (here)[https://mdk-packs.github.io/IoT_Socket/html/index.html].
